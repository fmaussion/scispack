# A simple python package template

**scispack** stands for "simple scientific package" or "super scientific
package" depending on your mood today.

It was written for the University of Innsbruck's
[scientific programming](http://fabienmaussion.info/scientific_programming)
lecture as a package template for the students.

It is an extended version of the
[sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) maintained by the
[Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/). The present
template doesn't include some of the overhead recommended for larger projects
targeting to be published on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). Instead, the focus is
put on my recommendations for package structure, development and testing.

With the exception of the ``setup.py`` file which was adapted from the
[sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject) package, all the
code in this repository is dedicated to the public domain.
